                                <p>
                                    This is Dairy Queen's signature meal, consisting of chicken strips served with french fries, Texas toast and a choice of sauce.
                                </p>

                            <p>
                                Burger King Chicken Fries were first offered as a novelty item in 2005, and according to reports, when they were pulled from the menu, fans started a (link unavailable) petition and various social media campaigns to get them back in circulation.

                                <p>
                                    These are fashioned after churros but are crunchy instead of soft and are too sweet.
                                </p>

                                    This shake is not that exciting and you can probably make a better one at home.

                                <p>
                                    These cakes are too rich and have a lot of chocolate.
